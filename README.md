# 🛠 Skills

## 💻 Technology

### Python⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My "native" programming language, I've worked with it for over 5 years. I've used it in machine learning with tensorflow and keras and in ml service backend development for APIs with Flask and Docker.

### Tensorflow/Keras⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

My "native" framework, I've worked with it for over 5 years. I've used it in time series classification tasks, agent systems, convolutional networks for image classification and transformers for text analysis. I am proficient in implementing custom layers and models from scientific articles.

### SQL⭐️⭐️

I had used small SQLite databases in several areas with python for over a year.

### GUI Apps⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I develop GUI apps with QT5 and QML from form design to packaging and distribution. I am proficient in packaging python ML apps into desktop applications — two of three projects I helped launch were from this area.

# 📚 Education

## Postgraduate **Degree in Technology**

*2017-2021,* Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, Ufa

Studied DQN agent neural networks and their performance in non-stationary environment in order to find agent architecture to strengthen adaptive abilities via state-action-stimuli memory. Results of postgraduate research are published on GitHub: [https://github.com/ustyuzhaninky/OSAR-keras/tree/legacy](https://github.com/ustyuzhaninky/OSAR-keras/tree/legacy).
